\section*{Figure captions}

%%% Please be aware that for original research articles we only permit a combined number of 15 figures and tables, one figure with multiple subfigures will count as only one figure.
%%% Use this if adding the figures directly in the mansucript, if so, please remember to also upload the files when submitting your article
%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.eps and logos.eps) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%%  NB logo1.eps is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page header %%%

%%% If you are submitting a figure with subfigures please combine these into one image file with part labels integrated.
%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.

(C): data set projected on the three coordinates of the latent AE space space. The density of points is projected in 2D histograms on the lateral planes. Colors correspond to the Xu classification.

As an example, a single node is connected to its closest neighbors by red lines. (B) Hit map: the size and color of the hexagon corresponds to the number of data points associated to the node, and the lines between nodes correspond to their relative distance. (C): Value of one of the input features of the model, the oxygen ion charge state ratio, for each one of the nodes. (D): example of the statistics applied to the points associated to each node, in this case mean value of `avqO' in color, with solar wind type hits as hexagon size.
